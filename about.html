    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p class = heading>
       

        I grew up in the metro Detroit area. After spending a few years in New York, I settled in Detroit.
        In the past I have worked mostly in the medical field- as a paramedic, in education, and in medical
        technician roles. After a discussion with a friend who works a developer, I realised I was looking for 
        something more challenging and mentally engaging and decided to attend a back end bootcamp. Outside of 
        bootcamp, I enjoy visiting with my family, dancing, baking and playing roller derby. 
        I have been playing roller derby for since 2015 and have played for teams in New York and Michigan.
